# mac
mac is a simple virtual machine created for educational purposes. Here is the accompanied [blog post](https://felixangell.com/blog/virtual-machine-in-c/).

There is a slightly more extended example in the [mac-improved](mac-improved/) folder.

In addition, there is a more complicated virtual machine written in C in the same style as mac [here](https://github.com/felixangell/krug/tree/master/vm) I wrote as a target for my 'krug' compiler.
